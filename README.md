# Mini Data Analysis project for stat545

Introductory self guided project using R and Rmd.

In this project, I analyzed datasets within the datateachr library using the dpyr and ggplot2 library. The project is split into three milestones and in each milestone directory, there is a markdown file to view the instructions, answers and code for each milestone.  

Milestone 1 mainly focus on exploring the different datasets in the datateacher library and drafting potential research questions. 

Milestone 2 focuses more on the research questions and created summary tables and graphs to plot the research question.

Milestone 3 is focused on created a model that answers the research question and writing the results on the computer. The output summary table and model is written to the output directly.
