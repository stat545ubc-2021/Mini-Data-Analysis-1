# Mini Data Analysis project for stat545

Introductory self guided project using R and Rmd.

In this project, I analyzed datasets within the datateachr library using the dpyr and ggplot2 library. The project is split into three milestones and in each milestone directory, there is a markdown file to view the instructions, answers and code for each milestone.
