# Welcome to your last milestone in your mini data analysis project!

In Milestone 1, you explored your data and came up with research questions. In Milestone 2, you obtained some results by making summary tables and graphs. 

In this (3rd) milestone, you'll be sharpening some of the results you obtained from your previous milestone by:

+ Manipulating special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times. 
+ Fitting a model object to your data, and extract a result.
+ Reading and writing data as separate files.

**NOTE**: The main purpose of the mini data analysis is to integrate what you learn in class in an analysis. Although each milestone provides a framework for you to conduct your analysis, it's possible that you might find the instructions too rigid for your data set. If this is the case, you may deviate from the instructions -- just make sure you're demonstrating a wide range of tools and techniques taught in this class.

## Instructions

**To complete this milestone**, edit [this very `.Rmd` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/master/content/mini-project/mini-project-3.Rmd) directly. Fill in the sections that are tagged with `<!--- start your work here--->`. 

**To submit this milestone**, make sure to knit this `.Rmd` file to an `.md` file by changing the YAML output settings from `output: html_document` to `output: github_document`. Commit and push all of your work to your mini-analysis GitHub repository, and tag a release on GitHub. Then, submit a link to your tagged release on canvas. 

**Points**: This milestone is worth 40 points (compared to the usual 30 points): 30 for your analysis, and 10 for your entire mini-analysis GitHub repository. Details follow.

**Research Questions**: In Milestone 2, you chose two research questions to focus on. Wherever realistic, your work in this milestone should relate to these research questions whenever we ask for justification behind your work. In the case that some tasks in this milestone don't align well with one of your research questions, feel free to discuss your results in the context of a different research question.


# Setup

Begin by loading your data and the tidyverse package below: 

```{r, message = FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(datateachr)) 
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressMessages(library(broom))
```

From Milestone 2, you chose two research questions. What were they? Put them here.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->
1. *How does discounting a game affect the rating of the game?*
2. *To what extent does the number of achievements in a game affect their rating?*
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->


# Exercise 1: Special Data Types (10)

For this exercise, you'll be choosing two of the three tasks below -- both tasks that you choose are worth 5 points each. 

But first, tasks 1 and 2 below ask you to modify a plot you made in a previous milestone. The plot you choose should involve plotting across at least three groups (whether by facetting, or using an aesthetic like color). Place this plot below (you're allowed to modify the plot if you'd like). If you don't have such a plot, you'll need to make one. Place the code for your plot below.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

***1.1.1 How does discounting a game affect the rating of the game?***

```{R}
# Vector with all possible review level 
review_levels=c('Overwhelmingly Negative', 'Mostly Negative', 'Very Negative', 
                 'Negative', 'Mixed', 'Positive', 'Very Positive','Mostly Positive',
                 'Overwhelmingly Positive')

game_reivew_price <- steam_games %>%
  # Get review level by parsing string based on comma deliminator and keeping first object
  separate(all_reviews, sep=',', into=c("review"), remove=FALSE, extra = "drop", fill = "right") %>%
  filter(review %in% review_levels) %>% # Remove reviews not in correct format (e.g not enough review or NA) 
  mutate(num_reviews = stringr::str_extract(string = all_reviews, 
                                               pattern = "(?<=\\().*(?=\\))")) %>% # Obtain number of review based on value in bracket
  mutate(num_reviews = as.numeric(gsub(",", '', num_reviews))) %>% # Change number of review from string to int data type
  drop_na(original_price) %>% # Remove games without price 
  select(id, original_price, discount_price, review, num_reviews, release_date) %>% # Keep columns related to price and reviews
  mutate(discount = (original_price - discount_price )/original_price) %>%  # Create new column that is the percentage decrease in game price
  filter(original_price > discount_price)


game_reivew_price %>%
  ggplot(aes(review, discount)) + # X axis is review level 
  geom_jitter(aes(color = num_reviews > 500), alpha=0.3) + # Use jitter plot with alpha transparency and change color based on number of review
  coord_flip() + # Flip graph to show review level better
  xlab('Review Level') + # Change x axis
  ylab('Percentage discounted')  + # Change y axis
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + # Display as percentage
  scale_colour_discrete(breaks=c(TRUE, FALSE), 
                            labels=c("Over 500 reviews", "Less than 500 reviews")) + # Change color legend label
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) # Remove legend title

  
```

The graph above show the relationship between the percentage discount of a game and their review levels. Additionally, the number of review are shown using colors, games that had over 500 reviews are in blue whereas games with less than 500 reviews are in red. This graph shows that there are more games that are discounted with very positive, mostly positive, positive and mixed reviews compared to games with mostly negative, very negative or negative review. Moreover, games that are rated very positive or overwhelmingly positive have greater number of reviews. However, it is difficult to compare between review levels in this graph as the review level are ordered alphabetically, thus reordering using factor is necessary as shown in 1.2.1.

***1.1.2 To what extent does the number of achievements in a game affect their rating?***

```{R}
games_achievement <- steam_games %>%
  # Get review level by parsing string based on comma deliminator and keeping first object
  separate(all_reviews, sep=',', into=c("review"), remove=FALSE, extra = "drop", fill = "right") %>%
  filter(review %in% review_levels) %>% # Remove reviews not in correct format (e.g not enough review or NA) 
  # Change release_date to date format and keep year only
  separate(genre, sep=',', into=c("genre"), remove=TRUE, extra = "drop", fill = "right") %>%
  select(id, achievements, review, genre) %>% # Keep columns related to achievement review and genre
  mutate(achievements = case_when(is.na(achievements) ~ 0, # Change achievements with NA to 0 
                                    TRUE ~ achievements)) %>%
  drop_na(genre) %>% # Remove games without genre
  filter(achievements != 0) # Remove games with no achievement

games_achievement %>%
  filter(genre %in% c('Action', 'Indie', 'Casual', 'Adventure')) %>% # Manually filter for top genres
  ggplot(aes(review, achievements)) + # X axis is review level and y axis is achievement number
  geom_boxplot() + # Display as box plot
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log10') + # Transform achievement number using logg10 scale
  facet_wrap(~genre) + # Facet based on genre
  coord_flip() # Flip coordinate of graph

```

The boxplot above is looking at the relationship between the number of achievements in a game compared to their review level. Moreover, the graph is faceted based on the top genres in the database and because we hypothesized that casual and indie games may have lower number of achievement than other genres such as action and adventure. The graph above shows no major differences between genres in terms of the relationship between review level and achievements. It is difficult to interpret this plot as there are so much information in terms of review level. It would be better to reduce the number of review level and additionally add an 'other genere' facet to better display the data as shown in 1.2.2.  


<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Now, choose two of the following tasks.

1. Produce a new plot that reorders a factor in your original plot, using the `forcats` package (3 points). Then, in a sentence or two, briefly explain why you chose this ordering (1 point here for demonstrating understanding of the reordering, and 1 point for demonstrating some justification for the reordering, which could be subtle or speculative.)

2. Produce a new plot that groups some factor levels together into an "other" category (or something similar), using the `forcats` package (3 points). Then, in a sentence or two, briefly explain why you chose this grouping (1 point here for demonstrating understanding of the grouping, and 1 point for demonstrating some justification for the grouping, which could be subtle or speculative.)

3. If your data has some sort of time-based column like a date (but something more granular than just a year):
    1. Make a new column that uses a function from the `lubridate` or `tsibble` package to modify your original time-based column. (3 points)
        - Note that you might first have to _make_ a time-based column using a function like `ymd()`, but this doesn't count.
        - Examples of something you might do here: extract the day of the year from a date, or extract the weekday, or let 24 hours elapse on your dates.
    2. Then, in a sentence or two, explain how your new column might be useful in exploring a research question. (1 point for demonstrating understanding of the function you used, and 1 point for your justification, which could be subtle or speculative).
        - For example, you could say something like "Investigating the day of the week might be insightful because penguins don't work on weekends, and so may respond differently".
    


<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

***1.2.1 How does discounting a game affect the rating of the game?***


**Task Number**: 1) Produce a new plot that reorders a factor in your original plot, using the `forcats` package

```{R}
# Review levels ordered from lowest to highest
review_levels=c('Overwhelmingly Negative', 'Mostly Negative', 'Very Negative', 
                 'Negative', 'Mixed', 'Positive', 'Very Positive','Mostly Positive',
                 'Overwhelmingly Positive')

game_review_price_fct <- game_reivew_price %>%
  mutate(review = fct_relevel(review, levels = review_levels)) # Manually reordering review level from lowest to highest
 
game_review_price_fct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(review, discount)) + # X axis is review level 
  geom_jitter(aes(color = num_reviews > 500), alpha=0.3) + # Use jitter plot with alpha transparency
  coord_flip() + # Flip graph to show review level better
  xlab('Review Level') + # Change x axis
  ylab('Percentage discounted') + # Change y axis
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + # Display as percentage
  scale_colour_discrete(breaks=c(TRUE, FALSE), 
                            labels=c("Over 500 reviews", "Less than 500 reviews")) +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())
         

```

I decided to reorder the review level from lowest review to highest review level. This allows for a better compassion of amount discounted between rating level to show the gradual increase in review levels. I used fct_relevel to turn the review level into factor and manual change the ordering as shown in the review_levels vector. For example, now it more clearly illustrates the greater number of games discounted in positive review level compared to negative. Furthermore, it is clearly shown that there are more games that have over 500 reviews in positive review level then negative. 


<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

***1.2.2 To what extent does the number of achievements in a game affect their rating?***


**Task Number**: 2) Produce a new plot that groups some factor levels together into an "other" category

```{R}
games_achievement_fct <- games_achievement %>%
  mutate(genre = fct_lump_min(genre, 500)) %>% # Lump all genres with less than 1000 games into other category
  # Group review level into positive, mixed and negative
  mutate(review = factor(case_when(review %in% c('Overwhelmingly Positive', 'Positive', 'Very Positive','Mostly Positive') ~ 'Positive',
                                 review == 'Mixed' ~ 'Mixed',
                                TRUE ~ 'Negative'), levels = c('Positive', 'Mixed', 'Negative'))) 
  

games_achievement_fct %>%
  ggplot(aes(review, achievements)) +  # X axis is review level and Y axis is number of achievements
  geom_boxplot() + # Display boxplots
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log10') + # Perform log10 transformation on  achievement number
  facet_wrap(~genre) + # Facet based on genre
  coord_flip() # Flip graph
```

For the box-plot above, I decided to group genres with less than 500 games into an other category. This is a much better solution that the box-plot in 1.1.2 as it doesn't hide any information and allows for a better compassion with the rest of the data set. I used the fct_lump_min function from the forecat library to lump all genres with less than 500 games into the other group. Moreover, I grouped all positive review level into positive and all negative review level into negative review in order to reduce clutter and too much information as shown in 1.1.2. The plot above shows that negatively reviewed games tend to have lower achievement number compared to mixed and positive games. However, there is no signficiant change in this relationship between different genres.

# Exercise 2: Modelling

## 2.0 (no points)

Pick a research question, and pick a variable of interest (we'll call it "Y") that's relevant to the research question. Indicate these.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

**Research Question**: To what extent does the number of achievements in a game affect their rating?

**Variable of interest**: Number of achievements

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## 2.1 (5 points)

Fit a model or run a hypothesis test that provides insight on this variable with respect to the research question. Store the model object as a variable, and print its output to screen. We'll omit having to justify your choice, because we don't expect you to know about model specifics in STAT 545. 

- **Note**: It's OK if you don't know how these models/tests work. Here are some examples of things you can do here, but the sky's the limit. 
    - You could fit a model that makes predictions on Y using another variable, by using the `lm()` function.
    - You could test whether the mean of Y equals 0 using `t.test()`, or maybe the mean across two groups are different using `t.test()`, or maybe the mean across multiple groups are different using `anova()` (you may have to pivot your data for the latter two).
    - You could use `lm()` to test for significance of regression.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->
```{R}
aov.data <- aov(achievements ~ review + genre, data=games_achievement_fct) # One-way analysis of variance modeling between achievements, review and genre.

summary(aov.data) # Displaying summary information of model
```

As the research question is investigating the relationship between a quantitative variable, achievement number, and two qualitative variable, review level and genre, linear model would not be an appropriate model. Therefore, I decided to use a one-way analysis of variance as there are more than two categories for review levels and genre. The aov() function models the relationship between achievements, review level and genre in the games_achievement_fct data set. The summary of the one-way analysis of variance is shown above.  

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## 2.2 (5 points)

Produce something relevant from your fitted model: either predictions on Y, or a single value like a regression coefficient or a p-value. 

- Be sure to indicate in writing what you chose to produce. 
- Your code should either output a tibble (in which case you should indicate the column that contains the thing you're looking for), or the thing you're looking for itself.
- Obtain your results using the `broom` package if possible. If your model is not compatible with the broom function you're needing, then you can obtain your results by some other means, but first indicate which broom function is not compatible. 
  
<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->
```{R}
# Set of games with varying genre and review to test model
random_game = tribble(
  ~review, ~genre,
  #------|-------
  'Positive', 'Action',
  'Mixed', 'Action',
  'Negative', 'Action',
  'Positive', 'Casual',
  'Mixed', 'Casual',
  'Negative', 'Casual'
)

# Predict number of achievement based on review and genre
broom::augment(aov.data, newdata = random_game)
```

Using the one-way analysis of variance model in 2.1, we can predict the number of achievement in a game based on the review level and genre. The random_game tibble shows a set of six random games with varying reviews and genres. Using the model, we can predict the number of achievements based on the review and genre as shown in the .fitted column. The prediction is performed using the augment function as part of the broom library. This model can be used by game developer to determine how many achievements they should add in the game. For example, when creating an action game, developers should aim to add approximately 87 achievements whereas when creating a casual game, approximately 179 achievement should be added. However, further analysis needs to be done to determine if these relationships are significant.


<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->



# Exercise 3: Reading and writing data

Get set up for this exercise by making a folder called `output` in the top level of your project folder / repository. You'll be saving things there. 

## 3.1 (5 points)

Take a summary table that you made from Milestone 2 (Exercise 1.2), and write it as a csv file in your `output` folder. Use the `here::here()` function.

- **Robustness criteria**: You should be able to move your Mini Project repository / project folder to some other location on your computer, or move this very Rmd file to another location within your project repository / folder, and your code should still work.
- **Reproducibility criteria**: You should be able to delete the csv file, and remake it simply by knitting this Rmd file. 
  
<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

```{R}
achievement_summary <- games_achievement_fct %>% # Save summary statistic of achievement to achievement_summary
  group_by(review) %>% 
  summarize(mean_achievements = mean(achievements), 
            median_achievements = median(achievements),
            max_achievements = max(achievements),
            min_achievements = min(achievements),
            stdev_achievements = sd(achievements),
            n = n())
write.csv(achievement_summary, here::here('output', 'game_achievement_summary.csv')) # Write statistical summary to output directory
read.csv(here::here('output','game_achievement_summary.csv')) # Read saved data to ensure it is properly save 
```

The summary statistics for research question two was saved in a tibble called achievement_summary. We saved this tibble into a csv file by writing it into the output directory with the name game_achievement_summary.csv using the write.csv() function. To ensure that this file was saved properly, we read it using the read.csv and shown the output above. 

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## 3.2 (5 points)

Write your model object from Exercise 2 to an R binary file (an RDS), and load it again. Be sure to save the binary file in your `output` folder. Use the functions `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()`. 

- The same robustness and reproducibility criteria as in 3.1 apply here.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->
```{R}
saveRDS(aov.data, here::here('output','aov_achievement_review_model')) # Save One-Way ANOVA model to output directory
readRDS(here::here('output','aov_achievement_review_model')) # Read One-Way ANOVA

```

Similarly, to save the one-way analysis of variance model created in 2.1, saveRDS() function was used to write it to the output directory with the name aov_achievement_review_model. As a sanity check, the model was read using the readRDS() function to ensure the model was saved properly. The read model was output above. 

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

# Tidy Repository

Now that this is your last milestone, your entire project repository should be organized. Here are the criteria we're looking for.

## Main README (3 points)

There should be a file named `README.md` at the top level of your repository. Its contents should automatically appear when you visit the repository on GitHub. 

Minimum contents of the README file:

- In a sentence or two, explains what this repository is, so that future-you or someone else stumbling on your repository can be oriented to the repository.
- In a sentence or two (or more??), briefly explains how to engage with the repository. You can assume the person reading knows the material from STAT 545A. Basically, if a visitor to your repository wants to explore your project, what should they know?

Once you get in the habit of making README files, and seeing more README files in other projects, you'll wonder how you ever got by without them! They are tremendously helpful.

## File and Folder structure (3 points)

You should have at least four folders in the top level of your repository: one for each milestone, and one output folder. If there are any other folders, these are explained in the main README.

Each milestone document is contained in its respective folder, and nowhere else. 

Every level-1 folder (that is, the ones stored in the top level, like "Milestone1" and "output") has a `README` file, explaining in a sentence or two what is in the folder, in plain language (it's enough to say something like "This folder contains the source for Milestone 1").

## Output (2 points)

All output is recent and relevant: 

- All Rmd files have been `knit`ted to their output, and all data files saved from Exercise 3 above appear in the `output` folder. 
- All of these output files are up-to-date -- that is, they haven't fallen behind after the source (Rmd) files have been updated.
- There should be no relic output files. For example, if you were knitting an Rmd to html, but then changed the output to be only a markdown file, then the html file is a relic and should be deleted. 

Our recommendation: delete all output files, and re-knit each milestone's Rmd file, so that everything is up to date and relevant. 

PS: there's a way where you can run all project code using a single command, instead of clicking "knit" three times. More on this in STAT 545B!

## Error-free code (1 point)

This Milestone 3 document knits error-free. (We've already graded this aspect for Milestone 1 and 2)

## Tagged release (1 point)

You've tagged a release for Milestone 3. (We've already graded this aspect for Milestone 1 and 2)
